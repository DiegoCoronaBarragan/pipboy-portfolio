# 🟢 Pip-Boy Portfolio

A personal portfolio inspired by the **Fallout Pip-Boy interface**, built with **React and TypeScript (Strict Mode)**.  
This project simulates a retro-futuristic operating system to showcase my skills, experience, and projects through a modular and strongly-typed architecture.

Originally developed in JavaScript and later fully migrated to TypeScript to improve scalability, maintainability, and type safety.

## 📌 Features

- Pip-Boy style UI inspired by Fallout  
- Boot screen simulation  
- Tab-based navigation (STAT, INV, DATA, LOG)  
- Scanline and CRT-style visual effects  
- Fully migrated to TypeScript (strict configuration)  
- Type-safe state management using union types and generics  
- Modular and scalable component architecture  
- Responsive layout adapted to different screen sizes  

---

## 🛠️ Built With

- React  
- TypeScript (Strict Mode)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- CSS (custom styles & animations)  
- Vite  

---

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Strong typing with interfaces and union types  
- Generic reusable data structures  
- Safe DOM handling  
- Strict TypeScript configuration (`strict` mode + `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`)  
- Clean component separation (UI / Data / Logic)  
- Scalable folder structure

## 🚀 Why TypeScript?

The project was migrated to TypeScript to:

- Improve maintainability as the application grows  
- Prevent runtime errors through compile-time checks  
- Create clear component contracts  
- Enforce scalable architecture patterns

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is designed not only as a presentation tool but also as a demonstration of:

- Frontend architecture  
- Type-safe React development  
- UI/UX experimentation  
- Continuous improvement and refactoring practices
